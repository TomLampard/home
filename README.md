# Welcome to my little app

This is my personal site and portfolio, that also acts as my little playground to test new concepts
in 3d on the web. It is built on the T3 stack, using next js, prisma, tailwind, nextauth with delightful little three js & react-three-fiber sprinkles added ontop. 

If your into 3d and react apps I hope you find something of interest. 

## A massive thankyou and some links that I couldn't live without

We are truly blessed living in a time of shared information, knowledge and open source. There are so many amazing people throughout so many communities, and I thank the collective as a whole. 

You can find links to the amazing documentation for each of the pieces used here:-
